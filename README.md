#### Group LEGO Mindstorm project from "Ingeniørfaglig Innføringsemne", a course from the first semester 

This was a small project from our first semester. It was a LEGO Mindstorm project where we were given a lot of freedom regarding what we wanted to create. Our group chose to take inspiration from modern autonomous storage systems and built a small LEGO robot that would recieve simple instructions trough bluetooth to either pickup or place a storage unit in a grid. The robot consisted of three engines, one for each drivewheel and one for the lift, two color sensors and an EV3 unit. Everything ran on Python scripts. My role in the project was team leader and I mainly worked on the script for the LEGO robot itself.
